    | Certification
    |
    | The person or persons who have associated work with this document (the

    | hereby dedicates whatever copyright the dedicators holds in the work
    | of authorship identified below (the "Work") to the public domain. A
    | certifier, moreover, dedicates any copyright interest he may have in

    |
    | A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright
    | status of this work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts
    | may not shield him from liability if in fact the work certified is not

    | Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at
    | large and to the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors.
    | Dedicator intends this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment
    | in perpetuity of all present and future rights under copyright law,
    | whether vested or contingent, in the Work. Dedicator understands that
    | such relinquishment of all rights includes the relinquishment of all
    | rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those copyrights in the
    | Work.
    |
    | Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work
    | may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified,
    | built upon, or otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial
    | or non-commercial, and in any way, including by methods that have not
    | yet been invented or conceived.
